# Social Media Feed Recommendation Algorithm

## Overview

This project implements a recommendation algorithm for social media feeds. The algorithm is designed to enhance user engagement by providing personalized content recommendations based on user behavior and preferences.

## Features

- **User Behavior Analysis**: Analyzes user interactions such as likes, shares, comments, and viewing time.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends content similar to what the user has engaged with in the past.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends content based on the behavior of similar users.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines content-based and collaborative filtering for improved recommendations.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Continuously updates recommendations based on real-time user activity.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have JDK 8 or later installed. You can download it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
- **Maven**: Used for project build and dependency management. You can download it from [Maven's website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/a-muizz28/Social-Media-Feed-Recommendation-Algorithm.git
    cd Social-Media-Feed-Recommendation-Algorithm
    ```

2. **Build the Project**:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.recommendation.RecommendationAlgorithm"
    ```

## Usage

- **Data Input**: The algorithm expects user interaction data in a specified format. Ensure your data is formatted correctly before running the algorithm.
- **Configuration**: Modify the configuration files to set parameters for the recommendation algorithm such as similarity thresholds, the number of recommendations, and data sources.

## Code Structure

- **RecommendationAlgorithm.java**: The main class implementing the recommendation logic.
- **UserBehavior.java**: Handles user behavior data.
- **ContentFilter.java**: Implements content-based filtering.
- **CollaborativeFilter.java**: Implements collaborative filtering.
- **HybridRecommender.java**: Combines content-based and collaborative filtering methods.
- **config/**: Configuration files for the algorithm parameters.
